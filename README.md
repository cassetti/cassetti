HIDE ME IF: You get in drama (bro we're talking horses), you sexualize underage characters/ship incest, or you're just a general edgelord.

Also, I'm always on the 18+ server. I don't like talking to minors.

I hide liberally. If you're here because I hid your friend, usually it's because they were Komaeda (I fucking hate that guy) or another character/source that upsets me. Sorry!

I'm dissociative and sometimes my other parts front. If they do, SOMETIMES it'll say so in their name. It depends on who it is.

I wander around a lot. Usually I chill at spawn, docks, or the PM corner when it's active.

I've never touched TikTok and I've been on here since March 2017 so I don't really know where these new kids are coming from or what the hot new trends are.
