HIDE ME IF: You get in drama (bro we're talking horses), you sexualize underage characters/ship incest, or you're just a general edgelord. 

I'm dissociative and despise "syscourse" because I am an adult. Please grow up if you do any of that. I also don't care about ship drama as long as you're not being weird about kids, animals, or family.

Also, I'm always on the 18+ server. I don't like talking to minors.

I hide liberally. If you're here because I hid your friend, usually it's because they were Komaeda (I fucking hate that guy) or another character/ship/source that upsets me. Sorry!

I wander around a lot. Usually I chill at spawn, docks, or the PM corner when it's active.

I've never touched TikTok and I've been on here since March 2017 so I don't really know where these new kids are coming from or what the hot new trends are.

Sometimes, I'll get shy and leave if I'm approached. It's never anything personal! I'm also often off-tab.
